# Broadcast Projects

## FM Bush Antenna

Materials needed:

- 3 -5 meter length of common RG6 or RG59 (75 Ohm) coaxial cable

- (1) Type F Connector

- Utility knife and nail clippers

## GPIO EAS Switching Relay

This relay, allows your station's signal to pass through, unprocessed to transmitter chain.  When a CAP alert code is active. DTR asserts pin 4 High on a DB9 RS232 cable with 5 Volts during the alert.  When the alert is concluded, pin 4 goes low, allowing regular programming to pass through.  At present this works with DB9 cables to trigger external relays and supports GPIO headers on Raspberry Pi computers.   We would like to hear from anyone that has got this to work with a USB cable.  

__Parts List OpenBroadcaster EAS Relay__

Kit with diagram and assembly photos of a complete RS232 GPIO Switching Relay .  Special Thanks to [Pippin Technical](https://pippintech.com/) for this example  parts kit for the completed switching relay.  Full assembly takes 2 +/- hours for all mounting, cable prep, soldering and testing with the OB Alert Player. Might take a bit longer for groups that have never built one before.

# DIY Hall of Fame

## Switching Relay

Dave Currie of Faith FM Waterloo Ontario made this really professional EAS setup using a Intel NUC and a custom relay.  Nice work Dave!

## 20 Db Annenuation

Why bother buying a 15.00 inline adaptor when you can make it yourself with a few parts and a soldering iron.

‘H’ or ‘T’ pads may also be fabricated to accomplish the same level of attenuation.For a balanced signal, use an H-Pad: input_impedance=30k Ω, output_impedance=10k Ω. The example below provides approximately -20dB of attenuation using resistors R 1/2= 12k Ω; R 2=3.3k Ω; R 3/2=3.3k Ω (ground wires should also be connected).
